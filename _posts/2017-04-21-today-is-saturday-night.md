title: Today is Saturday Night
---

*Edit: Bear with me, as today is not a saturday night. But rest assured
that this was officailly written on a saturday.*

Today is Saturday. It is nighttime. Parks and recreation is playiong on the
telly. It's the episode with Fred Armisen as the leader of that cult. But it
wasn't night a few hours ago, when we went on a park adventure...

Today is Saturday. It is mid afternoon. We wanted to piknic somewhere to the
north. I had a spicy dave spicy checken killer sandwhich with a sweet pickle
(remind me to get the dill ones next time!) and some horeradish sauce from
great britian.

Armed with a bag of soon to be hand-me-downs, We embarked on a journey.
we would not forget. Towards the goodwill we marched, willing away the goods
that we once loved.

A thought popped into my head about the drawings on the memorial inside cal
andersen park. But I forgot what I was thinking of at that time. Maybe in
anotehr blog, when I've since visited that place again to jog my memory.

"I want to design the ideal swingset", she said. Again it was nighttime.

I pondere for a memob, for

"But imagine though. Imagine a swingset, that's 40' tall. Nothing is stopping
you from going as high as you could go.". Nothing can stop the force being
applied by the earth. But you could try.

"Did you use permanent marker?" said the lady on the tv.

"40' tall and you have a seatbelt, so you can't fall if you go to high.".

"Hey, you know that thing about pendulums? Where they always swing at the same
rate because it's actually a function of gravity?"

Alright, the cats are at a standoff. Both are kinda crazy right now. Winston
really instigates this stuff, what a butthead. I'm worried about them fighting
while we're not home.

Signing off for now. Till next time.
