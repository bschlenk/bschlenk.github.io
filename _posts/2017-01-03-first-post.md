title: First Post

First post! So I guess this is sort of a new year's resolution for me, to start
writing more. I'm learning jekyll as my way of blogging. I've used wordpress in
the past but this time I wanted to try something new. I've found myself using 
nothing more than Vim for a lot of my writing and note taking, so why not make 
it easy and use a command line based blogging system? I don't need anything
super fancy, just something who's ivories I can tickle. And as you can see, I'm
using the default jekyll theme because I have no idea how to customize things 
yet.

I've been thinking about what I can write as my first post all night. I've been
procrastinating all week. I just really want to start writing and getting my
thoughts out there. My thoughts tend to be full of tangents and I thought that
blogging might help me keep them in line.

The idea of using git as the basis for a blog platform excites me like a cat
hearing the sound of the refrigerator door opening. It creates so many
possibilities, like allowing one to see how the blog has changed over the years.
A built in time machine, waiting to be ridden back and forth.

*Disadvantages of writing in Vim that could probably be fixed with a plugin:*

* ~~Lack of spellchecking~~ Vim has [rudimentary spellhecking](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/spell.html#spell).
